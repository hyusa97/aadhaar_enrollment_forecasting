# Enhanced Forecasting Section

## Historical Context
The historical data used for forecasting has been collected from various sources, including government databases and previous studies. This provides a robust foundation for understanding the trends and patterns that inform our predictions.

## Confidence Intervals
To quantify the uncertainty in our forecasts, we have included confidence intervals which reflect the range within which the actual outcomes are expected to fall. This will help users understand the reliability of the predictions made by the model.

## What-if Scenarios
We have implemented functionality to analyze "what-if" scenarios. This allows users to modify certain parameters and see how those changes could impact future outcomes, providing a better understanding of potential futures based on different assumptions.

## Model Performance Metrics
To evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of our forecasting model, we will provide performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values. These metrics will help users gauge the model's predictive power and reliability.

## Export Functionality
Users can export the forecasted results along with the configuration parameters used for the forecasting. This feature facilitates easy sharing and further analysis of the results in different formats such as CSV and Excel sheets.
